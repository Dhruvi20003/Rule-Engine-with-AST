#Rule Engine Application#
This project centers around a customizable rule-based system, allowing users to define, store, and validate rules against different data sets. The backend is powered by Flask with MongoDB handling data storage, while the frontend is built with React to provide a seamless user interface.

Key Highlights
Custom Rule Creation: Users can easily generate logical rules (e.g., age > 30 AND salary > 50000) and save them.
Rule Validation: Users can input data and check if it satisfies the created rules.
Persistent Storage: All rules are securely stored in MongoDB for easy access and future use.
Seamless Interaction: The frontend communicates efficiently with the backend using HTTP APIs for rule operations.
Comprehensive Error Management: The system includes detailed error handling for a smooth user experience.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (required for the React frontend)
Python 3.x (for running the Flask backend)
MongoDB (either locally or remotely)
Installation
To get started, clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rule-engine-project.git
cd rule-engine-project
Setting up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend/
Install required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update MongoDB connection string if needed in app.py:
python
Copy code
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
Launch the Flask server:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the backend at http://localhost:5000.

Setting up the Frontend
Move to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend/
Install frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage Instructions
1. Creating a Rule
Visit the "Create Rule" section.
Enter your rule in the format: age > 30 AND salary > 50000.
Submit the rule. If successful, you'll get back a unique rule ID.
2. Evaluating a Rule
Go to the "Evaluate Rule" page.
Input the rule ID from the creation step.
Provide the dataset (in JSON format) to evaluate the rule. For example:
json
Copy code
{
  "age": 35,
  "salary": 60000
}
The result of the evaluation (true/false) will be displayed.
